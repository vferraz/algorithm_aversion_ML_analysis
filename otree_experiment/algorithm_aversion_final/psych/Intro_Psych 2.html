In the next few pages, you will be prompted to ask multiple-choice questions. 

You can earn an extra amount of {{C.POINTS_PSYCH}} points if you answer the questions carefully and honestly. 
In between the questionnaire, there will be a few control questions asking you to explicitly select an alternative.


<br><br>

The extra payoffs will only be gained <u>if all control questions are answered correctly.</u>
