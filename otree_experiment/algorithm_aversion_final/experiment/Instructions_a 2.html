    In this experiment, you will be presented with three product choices, which will be named generically. 
    <br><br>
    Each of the products has a <b>quality level</b>, which will be randomly allocated between the three alternatives. 
    During the experiment, you will have to select one of the products, and you will receive a payoff according to your selection, as in the example below:
    <br><br><br>
        <img src={{ static "instr_1.png" }} alt="instr1" style="width:75%" class="center">
    
<br><br>
The product quality levels introduce different probabilities of acquiring points as a payoff, defined as: 

<ul>
  <li><b>High quality</b> – {{C.PROB_3}} probability of receiving {{C.BASE_PAYOFF}} point </li>
  <li><b>Medium quality</b> – {{C.PROB_2}} probability of receiving {{C.BASE_PAYOFF}} point </li>
  <li><b>Low quality –</b> {{C.PROB_1}} probability of receiving {{C.BASE_PAYOFF}} point </li>
</ul>
 
You will have the opportunity to perform repeated product selections for {{C.NUM_ROUNDS}} rounds. 
The product qualities will remain unchanged across the rounds after initial random allocation. 
For example, if your quality allocation was Product 1: High, Product 2: Low, and Product 3: Medium; these values will remain throughout the experiment. 
<br><br>
If you learn which product is associated with which quality level, you will have higher chances of better payoffs. 
<br><br><br>

<h5>Questionnaire</h5>
<br>


When the experiment is finished, you will be redirected to a questionnaire with simple multiple choice questions. After that, 
you will  the conclusion page, where your results will be shown, as well as the final results and your earnings.
